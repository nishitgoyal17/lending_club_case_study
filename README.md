## General Information
• Consumer finance company faces a critical challenge in making informed loan
  approval decisions, as these decisions are fraught with two distinct risks: denying
  a loan to a creditworthy applicant, resulting in a loss of potential business, or
  approving a loan to a high-risk applicant, potentially leading to financial losses
  due to default.
• To mitigate these risks, we need to leverage Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  techniques on historical loan applicant data. This analysis aims to uncover
  meaningful patterns and insights within the dataset, specifically focusing on
  consumer attributes and loan attributes. By doing so, we seek to identify key
  indicators that correlate with the likelihood of loan default.
• Ultimately, the objective is to develop a robust understanding of how various
  factors influence the propensity for default, which will enable us to make datadriven
  decisions such as denying loans to high-risk applicants, adjusting loan
  amounts, or offering loans at higher interest rates when necessary
